// the time() method is defined in the section methods section and 
// is then directly used in the component template within the doube braces {{ and }}
// A method defined in the methods section can use the other methods of this section

// defining computed properties in the computed section:
// Every second leads to the automatic modification of the countX2 variable thanks to its definition in the computed section.

// the use of parseInt() function (defined as standard in JavaScript) to retrieve the value of this.start in integer form.
// Indeed, the attributes are transmitted in the form of character strings, hence the need to transform this.start into an integer value.

// It is possible to avoid transforming the attribute value into an integer value. All you have to do is indicate when
// using the attribute that you want to keep the JavaScript value and not the character string. We prefix the name of the attribute 
// with the character :, for example:, start='10'. In this case, the value 10 willbe transmitted and not the string "10".

// This makes it possible to be able to transmit in the attributes any types of values: numeric values, character strings, arrays, or objects.

// * the v-if directive is used to specify a condition. If true, the HTML element (or component) will be inserted into the HTML page.
// Otherwise, it will not be present.

// Let's use the v-if directive to indicate that we want to display the value of the counter
// only for values less than or equal to 20. As soon as the value 20 is exceeded, the counter is no longer displayed.

// the template include the v-if and v-else directives.

// Using backtick ' and ' to define the template avoids having to manage the concatenation of character strings on several lines.

// The <span> element on which the v-if directive is applied will be included in the HTML page only if the following condition
// is true: if count<=20. Beyond 20, only the time will be displayed without the counter value.
// The v-else directive is used to indicate an alternative when the condition expressed in 
// v-if is false. The element on which the v-else directive is used will be inserted into the HTML page if 
// the condition expressed in v-if is false.
