// To run Vue.js applications with the <script type="module"> tag in Google Chrome, you need to serve the files using a web server. The file:// protocol doesn't work for modules due to security restrictions.

// Here's an alternative approach that allows you to run the code using a simple web server:

// Install a simple web server: You can use a lightweight web server like "http-server" or any other web server of your choice. If you have Node.js installed, you can install "http-server" globally by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

// Copy code
// npm install -g http-server
// Start the web server: Navigate to the directory where your files are located using the terminal or command prompt. Then, start the web server by running the following command:

// Copy code
// http-server
// This will start the web server and provide you with a local address (e.g., http://localhost:8080) where you can access your files.

// Open the application in a web browser: Open Google Chrome (or any other browser) and enter the local address provided by the web server (e.g., http://localhost:8080/index.html) in the address bar. This will load your Vue.js application, and the counter component should be displayed and increment the count value.

// By following these steps, you'll be able to run the Vue.js application successfully in Go
